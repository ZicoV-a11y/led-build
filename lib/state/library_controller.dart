  ///     into a stale code path.
  ///   - The backfill worker's scheduler timer survives but its
  ///     class body might have been edited; on the next fire it
  ///     could behave inconsistently.

  /// Cancelling these gives the post-reload state a clean room

  ///   - Watchers continue firing (the streams survived); the
  ///     next event re-arms the quiescence debounce.
  ///   - The backfill worker auto-restarts at the next scan-end
  ///     boundary (see `_scanIntoSource`'s `finally` block).
